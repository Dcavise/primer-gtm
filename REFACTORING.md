# Primer GTM Refactoring Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the refactoring work done to improve the Primer GTM codebase, along with recommendations for future improvements.

## Completed Refactoring

### 1. Directory Structure Improvements
- Moved realEstate components from `/src/components/realestate/` to `/src/features/realEstate/components/`
- Created feature-specific hooks directories and moved hooks to their proper place
- Updated imports to use the new file locations

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed excessive console.log statements from registry.tsx
- Replaced direct console.log/error calls with the logger utility
- Enabled debug mode in the logger for development environments
- Improved validation in Supabase client to prevent hardcoded values
- Added input validation to querySalesforceTable method

### 3. Navigation Improvements
- Refactored MainLayout to use dynamic navigation items from the registry
- Eliminated duplicate navigation definitions

### 4. Added Developer Tools
- Created find-unused.js script to help identify unused files and imports
- Updated CLAUDE.md with improved project structure documentation

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### 1. Move Domain-Specific Components to Features
Move the following component groups to their respective feature directories:
- `/src/components/salesforce/*` → `/src/features/salesforce/components/`
- `/src/components/auth/*` → `/src/features/auth/components/`

### 2. Organize Hooks by Feature
Continue moving feature-specific hooks to their respective feature directories:
- `/src/hooks/use-salesforce-*.ts` → `/src/features/salesforce/hooks/`
- `/src/hooks/use-*-stats.ts` → `/src/features/admissionsAnalytics/hooks/`

### 3. Eliminate Duplicate Supabase Files
There are multiple Supabase client implementations which should be consolidated:
- Unify admin-client.ts and client.ts into a single client with proper role switching
- Create a single exports file for all Supabase functionality

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Run the find-unused.js script to identify and remove unused files
- Add ESLint rules to prevent direct console.log usage
- Add ESLint rules to enforce path alias usage for imports

### 5. Authentication Improvements
- Replace mock authentication with real Supabase authentication
- Implement proper error handling for authentication issues

### 6. Testing
- Add more comprehensive tests for critical components
- Create mock data for testing to avoid production data dependencies

### 7. Environment Configuration
- Create a proper environment configuration system
- Move all hardcoded values to environment variables

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with small, contained changes first:
   - Continue moving components to their feature directories
   - Update imports to use new locations
   - Clean up console.log usage

2. Tackle larger refactorings next:
   - Consolidate Supabase clients
   - Implement real authentication

3. Finally, add proper testing and documentation:
   - Add test coverage
   - Document architecture decisions
   - Create proper error handling guidelines

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. Always add new feature components to their respective feature directory
2. Always add new feature hooks to their respective feature directory
3. Use the logger utility instead of console.log/error
4. Always use path aliases (@/) for imports
5. Use React.FC<Props> type for all components
6. Follow feature-based organization for all new code
